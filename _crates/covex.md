Zero-dependency Ada/SPARK CLI tool for coverage analysis, proof verification,
test-result parsing, multi-standard safety-compliance assessment (DO-178C /
ISO 26262 / IEC 62304), and interactive dashboards.

- Source scanning: walks .ads files, extracts subprogram declarations, docstring
  annotations (@param, @return, @field, @formal), and HLR traceability tags
- Proof analysis: parses GNATprove gnatprove.out summaries; assesses SPARK
  assurance levels (Stone through Platinum)
- Test parsing: reads markdown test results for pass/fail counts (native Ada or
  AUnit format)
- DAL compliance: assesses DO-178C DAL A-E criteria (HLR coverage, orphan tags,
  test status, minimum SPARK proof level), re-labelled for ISO 26262
  (ASIL A-D/QM) and IEC 62304 (safety classes A-C) via --dal / --asil / --class
- Differential assessment: --compare-base / --coverage-delta snapshot a base
  revision on git, Mercurial, Subversion, Fossil, or jj without touching the
  working tree
- Multiple outputs: ANSI terminal report, SVG badges, Markdown reports,
  HTML dashboard, JSON API via a built-in HTTP/1.1 server, and a proof-aware
  SBOM (CycloneDX / SPDX / Markdown)
- Result caching: a content-addressed on-disk cache serves unchanged scan,
  proof, test, and manifest results without re-running the work
- Tooling: `status` reports the toolchain + VCS state, `man` installs a local
  man page, and the `prove` subcommand resolves gnatprove at run time
- Scalable: package/subprogram collections use Ada.Containers.Vectors
  (heap-allocated, no compile-time limits)
- Zero library dependencies: uses only the GNAT runtime library. gnatprove is
  NOT a declared dependency -- the prove subcommand resolves it at run time
  (per-project manifest, PATH, cached toolchain, or download), so the covex
  crate installs and builds with no toolchain beyond the GNAT compiler
-  Self-assessment: 100% docstring coverage, Platinum SPARK (725/725 VCs proved),
  DAL-C / ASIL B / Class A Achieved, 1186/1186 native tests passing
