XIA is a native Ada implementation of the XPath 1.0 specification.  XIA is built using the DOM component of AdaCore's XML/Ada implementation and code generated by AdaGOOP.

Submitting XPath queries is done via the XIA.XPath_Query function. The function returns a Dom.Core.Node_List, whose contents can be accessed with the function DOM.Core.Nodes.Item.
