CoAP-SPARK is a library implementing the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
as defined in
[RFC 7252](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252), developed in the SPARK 
language, the formally verified subset of the Ada programming language.

This version implements the client side of the protocol with some limitations:
- It does not support block-wise transfers.
- It does not support retransmission of messages.
- It only supports NoSec and PreSharedKey security modes.

See LICENSING for licensing information.
