Verifies that a KeyNub USB license dongle is genuine, reads and writes the
license records it holds, reads and increments its monotonic counters, and
encrypts data so that only a dongle can decrypt it.

The crate is Ada over the SDK's C ABI. The native library
(`keynub_licdongle`) is loaded at run time, so nothing is linked and no
library path is needed at build time; take the library for your platform from
the SDK repository's `natives/` folder and either put it on the system's
library path or name it with `Set_Library_Path`. Windows, Linux and macOS.
