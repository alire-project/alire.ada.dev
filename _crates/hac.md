HAC (HAC Ada Compiler) is a small, quickly compiling, open-source Ada compiler, covering a subset of the Ada language.
HAC is perhaps the first open-source (albeit partial) Ada compiler fully programmed in Ada itself.

Features:

* **Quick**: short programming-compilation-run-test cycles.
* Perfect for scripting jobs.
* Compiles Ada sources from any stream - file, internet, editor data, Zip archive, ...
* Compilation leaves zero compilation temp file - all is done in memory!
* Portable, fully programmed in Ada.
* Can be embedded into another software - see the [**LEA**](https://l-e-a.sourceforge.io/) editor - and even exchange data with it - see the `demo/data_exchange/exchange_native_side.adb` demo.
* **Free**, open-source.
