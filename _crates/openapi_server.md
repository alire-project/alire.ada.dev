[OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) is a code generator that supports generation of
API client libraries, server stubs and documentation automatically
given an [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

The Ada server support has been integrated in [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

The OpenAPI Ada library is a small support library for the Ada code generator
provided by OpenAPI Generator.  The library provides support to serialize the data,
make HTTP requests and support the [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
specific operations or types.

## Alire setup

```
alr with openapi_server
```

For the server part, you must choose a servlet web container that will handle the requests.
Two web server implementations are provided:

* [AWS](https://github.com/AdaCore/aws)
* [EWS](https://github.com/simonjwright/ews)

and you should run one of the following `alr` command depending on your choice:

```
alr with servletada_aws
alr with servletada_ews
```

## Generation

Example of server generation with OpenAPI file `my-api.yaml` and use of CURL support:

```
  alr exec -- openapi-generate-server -i my-api.yaml --additional-properties projectName=MyProject --additional-properties openApiName=OpenAPI --additional-properties httpSupport=Curl --model-package MyProject.MyModule -o .
```
